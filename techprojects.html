      <h1>Tech Projects</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Because why not</p>

      <p>Technology has long fascinated me, and I figure it's time I help out the community.</p>
      <p>
        Much of the interest here revolves around old technology, such as PowerPC Macs,
        although it also includes more modern systems such as 
        <a href="https://haiku-os.org">Haiku</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of this relies on porting existing software. While I have written some programs of
        my own, they certainly do not compare to the existing solutions.
      </p>

      <h2>PowerPC Ports</h2>
      <p>This section documents some software I have ported to PowerPC Macs running Mac OS X.</p>

      <p>Unless otherwise specified, the software requires the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>PowerPC Mac</li>
        <li>PowerPC G3, G4, or G5</li>
        <li>Mac OS X 10.4.11 Tiger</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some software may have specific builds optimized for a particular processor;
        you should download the one appropriate for yours.<br>
        If no specific builds are listed, then the software will work on any PowerPC processor of at least a G3.
      </p>

      <p>
        These ports should also work on Mac OS X 10.5.8 Leopard; note that running Leopard implies
        the usage of at least a G4.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, these ports may run on an Intel-based Mac running 10.4.4 Tiger to 10.6.8 Snow Leopard through Rosetta.<br>
        However, this has not been tested and may lead to suboptimal performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Watch this space!</h2>
      <p>
        Due to <a href="https://twitter.com/GriffintheFolf/status/1442977211758243843">hardware problems</a>,
        I have not yet begun porting software. However, some items I am interested in porting include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><i>3D Pinball Space Cadet</i></li>
        <li><i>Cube 2: Sauerbraten</i></li>
        <li>NetSurf</li>
        <li>Python 2.7.18 and 3.10.0</li>
      </ul>
