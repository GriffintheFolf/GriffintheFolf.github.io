      <p>
        Presented here is some various art I've had made for my fursona over time.<br>
        My ref is also provided should you want to make some art.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should go without saying, but <em>please do not steal anything here or
        claim it as your own!</em>

        The artists involved for all of these pieces - be it the base artists or the<br>
        colourists - have all worked very hard to make these pieces a reality. Please respect that.
      </p>
